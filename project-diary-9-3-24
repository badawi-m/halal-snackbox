What's worked on:

- Found out that low prof not compatible with mx footprint, need specific footprint
  for switch we want (gataron low prof)
- calculated estimate for cost of assembling five flatbox
	-> Shipping takes up most of cost, 
	-> can skip hotswap socket and directly solder instead
	-> might need to skip on acryllic for body case, 3d print for cheap
- replaced mx cherry footprint with gataron low prof footprint
	-> footprint accomodate solder + socket
- added another jump key for wasd layout


What still needs to be done:

- Add mounting hole for screws (screws will be M6 chicago screws)
- Add silkscreen art + text for *aesthetics*
- Estimate production cost if rp2040 chip is integrated on pcb instead of buying
  breakout board
- Modify v4 flatbox to fit current layout of halal box
- Design body case, buttons, etc for 3D printing
